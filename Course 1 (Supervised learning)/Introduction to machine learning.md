# Introduction to machine learning 

## What is maching learning? 
Machine learning is the study of computers learning from data and using data to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so.
- It is the process of making a machine "intelligent". 



### Applications of machine learning
 - Machine learning is widely used across multiple industries in a lot of applications. 
 - Examples include: 
   1. Agriculture improvement 
   2. Generative AI and Search engines 
   3. Biotechnology 
   4. Statistics and data science 
 - And many more like these.

### Types of machine learning
#### 1. Supervised learning
 - In Supervised learning, the algorithm learns to go from input to output (X -> Y). 
 - The algorithm **LEARNS** how to map an input to an output without being programmed explicitly. 
 - To do this, training data with inputs and the *right* outputs is provided, and eventually the model learns how to assign an output label to unseen inputs. 
 - The main types of supervised learning are (a) Classification and (b) Regression

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- In Unsupervised learning, the machine is given data and no associated output labels. 
- The goal is to map patterns in the data and use these patterns to identify different classes of the subject. eg: people. 
- The main types of unsupervised learning are (a) Clustering (b) Anomaly detection (c) PCA (dimensionality reduction)
- This is the second widely used type of machine learning. 


#### 3. Reinforcement learning 
- In reinforcement learning, an action-reward system is set up and the training data does not contain outputs. 
- The model performs actions, starting with random predictions, and then slowly learning from its experiences leading to correct predictions. 
- When the model makes a bad prediction, it gets punished. When it makes a good prediction, it gets rewarded. 
- The goal is to maximise the rewards function by making accurate predictions. 

#### 4. Semi - Supervised learning 
- This is a combination of both supervised and unsupervised learning. 
- A certain amount of labelled data is provided and the machine learns to ground predictions with this data. 
- Then, a larger unlabelled dataset is given and the algorithm learns the distribution or shape of the data. 
- Using these, we can develop algorithms such as Gradient Descent, and more.
